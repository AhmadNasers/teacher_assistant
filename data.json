We'll start with the first one.\n\n**(1) Factorize \\( (4y - 5y²)² * 80y \\)**\n\nTo factor this expression, we can break it down into parts. Let's focus on each section of the expression. \n\n1. **Factor \\( (4y - 5y²) \\)** first. Do you notice any common factors in the terms \\( 4y \\) and \\( -5y² \\)? \n   \n2. **What can you factor out from \\( (4y - 5y²) \\)?** \n\nOnce you find that, then you can consider what happens when you square it. Can you give that a try?",
